### **Integration with Current Heat Seeker**

To integrate these agents into your current `heat_seeker.py`:

1. **Replace single AI call** with multi-agent coordination:
```python
# Instead of: result = get_ai_recommendation(symbol, data, news)
# Use: coordinator_result = coordinator_bot.process_symbol_analysis(symbol)
```

2. **File-based communication** between agents:
```python
# Each agent writes to: /mt5_data/analysis/{agent_name}/{symbol}_{timestamp}.json
# Other agents read from: glob.glob(f"/mt5_data/analysis/{agent_name}/{symbol}_*.json")[-1]
```

3. **Coordinator Bot routing**:
```python
def process_symbol_analysis(symbol):
    # Send to Market Analysis Agent
    market_data = market_agent.analyze(symbol)
    
    # Send to Sentiment Agent  
    sentiment_data = sentiment_agent.analyze(symbol)
    
    # Send to Strategy Agent
    strategy_signal = strategy_agent.generate_signal(symbol, market_data, sentiment_data)
    
    # Send to Risk Agent
    risk_approval = risk_agent.assess_trade(symbol, strategy_signal)
    
    # Final coordination
    return coordinator.make_final_decision(strategy_signal, risk_approval)
```
