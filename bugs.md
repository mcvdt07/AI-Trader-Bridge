# üêõ Heat Seeker CSV Logging System Issues

## Overview
The CSV logging system has critical issues tracking trades through their complete lifecycle. The current flow should be:
1. `high_heat_symbols_ai.csv` (AI Recommendations) ‚Üí 
2. `open_trades.csv` (Active Trade Tracking) ‚Üí 
3. `trade_performance.csv` (Closed Trade Performance)

NOTE: This file has been updated to reflect fixes merged to main via PR #1 on 2025-10-24T10:30:42Z. All items below marked as resolved indicate implementation in that PR. See PR: https://github.com/mcvdt07/AI-Trader-Bridge/pull/1

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Recommendation ID System
- [x] **Problem Identified**: No unique ID to track recommendations through their lifecycle
- [x] `high_heat_symbols_ai.csv` lacks unique recommendation IDs
- [x] Cannot link trades back to original AI recommendations
- [x] Makes performance analysis impossible

**Impact**: 
- Cannot track which AI recommendation led to which trade
- Cannot analyze AI recommendation accuracy
- Cannot identify patterns in successful vs failed recommendations

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**: 
- [x] Add `Recommendation_ID` column to `high_heat_symbols_ai.csv`
- [x] Generate UUID-based IDs for each recommendation and preserve them across CSVs
- [x] Carry this ID through all subsequent CSVs and logging functions

Notes: Recommendation_ID generation and preservation implemented in update_single_symbol(), trade opening logic, and CSV save/load helpers.

### 2. Open Trades CSV Issues (`open_trades.csv`)

#### 2.1 Incomplete Trade Saving
- [x] **Problem Identified**: `save_open_trades()` function has data integrity issues
- [x] **Line 120-131**: Function saves trades but missing validation
- [x] **Line 1238-1252**: Trade opening logic doesn't consistently save to CSV
- [x] Position ID sometimes missing or not properly captured

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Ensure `save_open_trades()` validates trade data before writing
- [x] Ensure trade opening logic captures and persists position_id reliably
- [x] Implement fallbacks and logging when position capture fails

#### 2.2 Missing Rationale Transfer
- [x] **Problem Identified**: Rationale from `high_heat_symbols_ai.csv` not carried to `open_trades.csv`
- [x] **Line 1242-1252**: Trade opening doesn't capture rationale from AI recommendations
- [x] Rationale is available in CSV but not transferred to open trades

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Transfer `Original_Rationale` and `Heat_Score` into `open_trades.csv` on trade open
- [x] Updated CSV structure and saving/loading functions

#### 2.3 Timestamp Issues
- [x] **Problem Identified**: Inconsistent timestamp formats
- [x] `open_time` format not standardized
- [x] Makes date comparisons and filtering difficult

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Standardize timestamps to ISO 8601 (datetime.isoformat) and add parsing compatibility for legacy formats

### 3. Trade Performance CSV Issues (`trade_performance.csv`)

#### 3.1 Major History Reading Problems
- [x] **Problem Identified**: `track_automatic_closures()` function has critical flaws
- [x] **Line 775-890**: Multiple issues in closure detection

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Complete rewrite of `track_automatic_closures()` to use position_id-based deal grouping
- [x] Avoid unreliable symbol matching; group deals by position_id for accurate closure detection
- [x] Remove problematic in-place removal patterns that led to missed entries

#### 3.2 Profit/Loss Calculation Issues
- [x] **Problem Identified**: P/L calculation is inconsistent
- [x] Sometimes uses individual deal profit
- [x] Sometimes sums multiple deals
- [x] No validation of calculation accuracy

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Use grouped deals per position_id to calculate total P/L consistently
- [x] Validate computed P/L against deal records and handle None/edge values safely

#### 3.3 Missing Data Fields
- [x] **Problem Identified**: Critical fields missing from performance tracking
- [x] No Recommendation_ID linking back to original AI decision
- [x] No Heat Score tracking for performance analysis
- [x] No entry/exit timing analysis
- [x] Missing original AI rationale

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Add `Recommendation_ID`, `Heat_Score`, `Original_Rationale`, and `Duration_Hours` to `trade_performance.csv`

### 4. Data Flow Integrity Issues

#### 4.1 Ticket vs Position ID Confusion
- [x] **Problem Identified**: Code mixes MT5 ticket numbers and position IDs
- [x] **Line 113**: CSV uses "Ticket" but stores position info
- [x] **Line 782**: `track_automatic_closures()` expects position_id but gets mixed data
- [x] **Line 296**: Sometimes position_id is 0 when capture fails

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Clear distinction and consistent usage of `ticket` vs `position_id`
- [x] Store both when available and prefer position_id for deal history lookups

#### 4.2 Symbol Mapping Problems
- [x] **Problem Identified**: Yahoo symbols vs MT5 symbols cause tracking issues
- [x] **Line 863**: `symbol.replace('-', '')` doesn't always match MT5 format
- [x] Cross-reference between symbol formats is unreliable
- [x] Affects deal history matching

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Implement symbol mapping dictionary `symbols_mt5` and fallback logic
- [x] Avoid brittle string manipulation and use explicit mapping for lookups

### 5. Function-Specific Issues

#### 5.1 `save_open_trades()` Function Issues
**Location**: Lines 114-131
- [x] No validation of trade data before saving
- [x] Missing recommendation ID field
- [x] No error handling for corrupted data

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Added validation, Recommendation_ID, and robust error handling

#### 5.2 `load_open_trades()` Function Issues  
**Location**: Lines 96-113
- [x] Doesn't handle missing position_id gracefully
- [x] No validation of loaded data
- [x] Silent failures on corrupted CSV

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Added validation, graceful fallbacks, and logging for corrupted rows

#### 5.3 `track_automatic_closures()` Function Issues
**Location**: Lines 775-890
- [x] Complex logic with multiple failure points
- [x] Unreliable deal history matching
- [x] Symbol normalization problems
- [x] Missing error handling for edge cases

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Rewrote logic to be position_id-first, grouped deals lookup, and robust error handling

#### 5.4 `log_closed_trades()` Function Issues
**Location**: Lines 720-774
- [x] Duplicate functionality with `track_automatic_closures()`
- [x] Different logic for same task creates inconsistency
- [x] Uses position_id in some places, ticket in others

**Fix Implemented (PR #1)**:
- [x] Consolidated closure logging logic and ensured consistent field usage
